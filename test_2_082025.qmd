## Lecture Outline


- Examine how interactive data visualization changes scientific inference in biomedical research
- Contrast static figures with interactive dashboards that support controlled data exploration
- Discuss why interactivity is essential for multidimensional biomedical questions that cannot be resolved with a single static view
- Compare static vs. interactive figures

## Defining Interactive Dashboards

- interactive data visualization has become central to how biomedical evidence is explored, interpreted
- analysts, clinicians, and decision-makers interact with data— stratifying by biomarkers, adjusting thresholds, and exploring uncertainty in real time
- traditional static figures represent a fixed analytical decision: the cohort is pre-defined, the model is specified, and the visualization reflects a single analytical view
- interactive visualizations allow users to explore multiple analytical views from the same underlying dataset

## Defining Interactive Dashboards

- Interactive dashboards: structured analytical interfaces that allow users to dynamically explore, filter, and compare biomedical data while remaining anchored to a single, governed data source

- Static figures: enable controlled interaction—such as cohort selection, stratification, and linked views—so that clinicians, scientists, and decision-makers can interrogate evidence without altering the underlying analysis pipeline

## Why Static Figures Fall Short for Complex Biomedical Questions


- Many biomedical questions are intrinsically multidimensional and cannot be resolved through a single contrast or summary statistic
- Clinical datasets often require simultaneous conditioning on biomarkers, treatment history, dose, time, and patient characteristics

## Why Static Figures Fall Short for Complex Biomedical Questions

- Public health surveillance data shift across geography and time
- Static figures force these dimensions to be collapsed prematurely, often masking important structure or heterogeneity
  - each additional question requires a new reduction of the data, slowing the analytical cycle and increasing interpretive lag

## Why Static Figures Fall Short for Complex Biomedical Questions

- a single biomedical dataset is typically interrogated along multiple analytical dimensions: clinical relevance, biological plausibility, and methodological validity
  - Resulting figures are different projections of the same underlying data
- static figures reflects a chain of analytical decisions: cohort definitions, stratifications, model specifications, inclusion criteria, and assumptions about missingness and time



::: footer
:::

## Why Static Figures Fall Short for Complex Biomedical Questions


- static figures freeze that chain into a single outcome, obscuring how the result depends sets of preliminary analytical choices
- when results are communicated through static figures, each projection is often materialized as a separate plot, subset, or report

## Defining Interactivity in Data Analysis

- Interactivity refers to user-driven operations that modify what data are shown or how they are summarized
- Example operations include: filtering, sorting, brushing, zooming, parameter adjustment, and coordinated highlighting across views
- Interactivity allows a single dataset to support multiple analytical questions
- Example: a clinician may want to examine outcomes stratified by disease stage, while a researcher may explore molecular subtypes, and a regulator may focus on enrollment sites or protocol deviations

## Defining Interactivity in Data Analysis

- Interactivity preserves a single governed analytical backbone while allowing multiple controlled views
- Filters, stratifications, and linked displays operate within the same computational framework, ensuring that all exploration remains anchored to the same evidence
- Interactivity allows domain experts to navigate these dimensions directly, interrogating the data in real time while remaining within predefined analytical constraints
- Reduction in time between data generation and decision-making—an essential capability in clinical and biomedical research

## Static vs. Interactive Representations of TCGA Data

Interactivity allows analysts to examine how results depend on analytical choices, including population definitions, measurement models, and stratification thresholds, rather than treating these choices as fixed

In oncology, dashboards are increasingly used as analytical workspaces, supporting tasks such as cohort exploration, survival comparison, and biomarker-based stratification across heterogeneous patient populations

## <span style="font-size:80%">Static vs. Interactive Representations of TCGA Data</span> {.smaller}


- Static data visualization displays fixed output from a previous analytical pipeline so that the reader can see the same result in the same way
- Within the selected figure, the authors have already decided which data to include, how to process it, how to group samples, and what comparisons to show
- The figure displays the same evidence under the same assumptions - ideal for communicating clear scientific conclusions and for ensuring that results can be discussed, critiqued, and reproduced consistently

Interactive dashboards work differently: users can change cohorts, features, thresholds, and comparison groups, and each interaction effectively generates a new analysis

Interactive plots can help address the following:

- What questions can be asked
- How quickly evidence can be interrogated
- Who participates in inference

## <span style="font-size:80%">Static vs. Interactive Representations of TCGA Data</span> {.smaller}

- Thorsson, V., et al. (2018) figure presented TCGA immune structure under fixed analytical decisions, producing a stable, publication-grade reference view of tumor immune states
- Next we’ll explore an interactive representation of similar TCGA immune data, where key analytical choices—cohort selection, gene stratification, immune modeling, and comparisons—are exposed to the user
- tcgaViz dashboard (Camenen et al.) transforms immune deconvolution results into a reactive analytical environment, allowing users to explore how immune cell distributions change under different assumptions

This shift does not replace static analysis; instead, it changes the scientific question:

 From “What did the authors find under these assumptions?” $\rightarrow$ To “How do conclusions change when assumptions change?”

## <span style="font-size:80%">tcgaViz Dashboard Overview</span> {.smaller}

Immune cell abundance varies widely across tumors, even within the same cancer type

TCGA-VIZ is an interactive analytical dashboard designed to explore associations between tumor gene expression and inferred immune cell composition across TCGA cancer cohorts.

- **Data source**: TCGA RNA-seq (gene-level expression)

- **Inference layer**: Immune deconvolution algorithms (e.g., CIBERSORT_ABS)

- **Scientific question encoded in dashboard**:
 How does the abundance of specific immune cell types differ between tumors with high vs low expression of a given gene?

**Static Figure**

- Focused on a specific hypothesis
- Requires the author to interpret, annotate, and guide the viewer
- Excellent for teaching, assessment, and dissemination

**Dynamic Dashboard**

- Focused on self-directed data interrogation
- Users discover patterns before formally testing them
- Shifts burden of interpretation to the user


Advantages:

- Can quickly rule out many null hypotheses
- Supports real-time subgroup analysis
- Enables personalized discovery (e.g., “show me how TP53 expression relates to macrophage M1”)
